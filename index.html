<p>storylines. . . . Sometimes Stan would type up a written plot outline for the artist. Sometimes,
     not."[10] As comic-book writer-editor Dennis O'Neil describes, the Marvel method ". . . r
     equires the writer to begin by writing out a plot and add[ing] words when the penciled ar
     twork is finished. . . .[I]n the mid-sixties, plots were seldom more than a typewritten pag
     e, and sometimes less," while writers in later times "might produce as many as twenty-five
      pages of plot for a twenty-two page story, and even include in them snatches of dialog. S
      o a Marvel Method plot can run from a couple of paragraphs to something much longer and mo
      re elaborate."[11]
    The Marvel method was in place with a
    t least one artist by early 1961, as Lee descr
    ibed in 2009 when speaking of his and Ditko's "short, five-p
    age filler strips ... placed in any of our comics that had a few extra 
    pages to fill", most prominently in Amazing Fantasy but even previously in Am
    azing Adventures and other "pre-superhero Marvel" science-fiction/fantasy anthology titles.</p>
